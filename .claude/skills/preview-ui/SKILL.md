# Preview UI (Claude Code Tray)

The cardinal rule of UI work in this repo: **never claim a window looks right without looking at it.**
WinForms/WPF layout is easy to get wrong on paper; this skill closes the loop by rendering the real
window and capturing a PNG you can read back.

## When to use

- After editing `SettingsWindow.xaml` or `SettingsWindow.xaml.cs`.
- After any change that affects a windowed surface (new settings page, new dialog).
- Before telling the user a UI change is done.

## How it works

The app exposes a deterministic preview entry point so the window can be shown **without** clicking
through the tray menu:

```
ClaudeTray.exe --settings      # opens just the Settings window, standalone
```

`scripts\Capture-Window.ps1` launches that, waits for the first paint, makes itself
per-monitor-DPI-aware (critical on 150–200% displays or the capture is offset/scaled), copies the
window's rectangle to a PNG, and kills the process.

## Steps

1. **Build** (Debug is fine and fast):

   ```
   dotnet build -c Debug
   ```

2. **Capture** (default output is `docs\_preview\settings.png`, which is git-ignored):

   ```
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\Capture-Window.ps1
   ```

   To preview a different window/args or output path:

   ```
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\Capture-Window.ps1 -AppArgs "--settings" -Out "docs\_preview\foo.png"
   ```

3. **Look** at the PNG with the Read tool (`docs\_preview\settings.png`) and judge the layout:
   alignment, spacing, overlap, theme (light/dark follows the Windows setting), accent color
   (follows the Windows accent), and that every control rendered.

4. **Iterate**: edit the XAML, rebuild, recapture, re-read — until it's right. Only then report done.

## Notes

- The screenshot copies from the screen, so keep the window unobscured during capture; the script
  brings it to the foreground, but a modal/topmost overlay could still cover it.
- To preview light vs dark, toggle the Windows app theme; `ThemeMode="System"` makes the window
  follow it. There is no in-app theme switch.
- The tray icon itself is GDI+, not WPF — preview those with `dotnet run -- --render <dir>` instead
  (dumps PNGs at 16/20/32 px). See AGENTS.md.
