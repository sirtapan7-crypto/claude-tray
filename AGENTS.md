# AGENTS.md — Claude Code Tray

Foundation doc for working in this repo with maximum predictability and minimum friction.
Read this before touching UI or build. Keep it current when conventions change.

## What this is

A native **Windows tray** app (.NET 10, `win-x64`) that shows your Claude Code rate-limit usage as a
crisp, DPI-aware icon, with burn-rate projection and a local 24h usage breakdown. Ships as a single
self-contained `.exe` (no .NET needed to run) via an Inno Setup installer with in-app auto-update.

Unofficial / community project — not affiliated with Anthropic. Reads only usage data Claude Code
already stores locally; never message content.

## Tech stack — three layers, don't mix them up

| Layer | Tech | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Tray icon + menu + lifetime | **WinForms** (`NotifyIcon`, `ApplicationContext`) | WinForms owns tray icons; WPF has no native tray support. Keep it. |
| Icon pixels | **GDI+ / System.Drawing** (`IconRenderer`) | Vector draw at the exact tray size (`SM_CXSMICON`), DPI-aware. Never a downscaled bitmap. |
| Windows (Settings, future dialogs) | **WPF + built-in .NET Fluent theme** (`ThemeMode="System"`) | Declarative XAML = predictable layout; Fluent = Windows 11 look; **zero extra deps**, so the single-exe/installer story is untouched. |

Both `UseWindowsForms` and `UseWPF` are `true` in `ClaudeTray.csproj`. They coexist on one STA
thread: `Application.Run(new TrayContext())` (WinForms) pumps messages for both. A single
`System.Windows.Application` is created lazily in `Program.OpenSettings` (never `Run()`) so WPF's
Fluent theme + pack-URI resources resolve. (Enabling `UseWPF` drops `System.IO` from implicit
usings — it's re-added via `<Using Include="System.IO" />` in the csproj. Don't remove that.)

## File map

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `Program.cs` | Entry point, CLI flags, `TrayContext` (tray icon, menu, poll/flash timers), `OpenSettings`. |
| `ApiClient.cs` | Reads OAuth token from `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, calls the API, parses `anthropic-ratelimit-unified-*` headers. |
| `BurnTracker.cs` | Utilization history → least-squares slope → projects exhaustion (`Projection.Ok/Danger/Unknown`). |
| `UsageInsights.cs` | Aggregates last 24h of `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` into a cost-weighted breakdown. |
| `IconRenderer.cs` | GDI+ icon (vector number + outline + fill bar + projection color) at the real size; also the app `.ico` and social image. |
| `Updater.cs` | Checks GitHub Releases; downloads/runs the installer for in-app self-update. `CurrentVersion`. |
| `Settings.cs` | `Settings` model (JSON in `%LocalAppData%\ClaudeTray`); clamps out-of-range values. |
| `SettingsWindow.xaml(.cs)` | The WPF Fluent settings window. **All layout lives in the XAML.** |

## UI conventions — the rules that prevent the bugs we already hit

1. **Layout is declarative.** Put structure in XAML grids with explicit `RowDefinition`/
   `ColumnDefinition`. A `*`-sized spacer row pushes a footer down; `Auto` sizes to content.
2. **Never stack by imperative z-order.** The original WinForms sidebar used multiple `Dock=Top`
   labels relying on reverse add-order and they overlapped. If you must use WinForms, stack with a
   `TableLayoutPanel` (explicit rows), never sibling `Dock=Top`.
3. **Theme via `ThemeMode="System"`** and color via `{DynamicResource ...}` Fluent brushes
   (`TextFillColorPrimaryBrush`, `CardBackgroundFillColorDefaultBrush`, `LayerFillColorDefaultBrush`,
   `AccentFillColorDefaultBrush`, `SubtleFillColorSecondaryBrush`, `CardStrokeColorDefaultBrush`,
   `DividerStrokeColorDefaultBrush`, `AccentButtonStyle`). These auto-adapt to light/dark and the
   system accent. Don't hardcode hex for theme-able surfaces.
4. **A window class exposed to WinForms code must be `internal`** (the model `Settings` is internal):
   add `x:ClassModifier="internal"` to the XAML root and `internal partial class` in code-behind.
5. **Verify by looking, every time.** See the workflow below. Do not report a UI change as done
   without a screenshot.

## Visual verification workflow (the predictability loop)

Use the **`preview-ui`** skill, or directly:

```
dotnet build -c Debug
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\Capture-Window.ps1   # -> docs\_preview\settings.png
```

Then Read `docs\_preview\settings.png` and judge it. `--settings` opens the window standalone so no
tray-menu clicking is needed; the capture script is per-monitor-DPI-aware (required at 150–200%).
`docs\_preview\` is git-ignored.

## Build / run / dev helpers

```
dotnet build -c Debug                 # fast compile check
dotnet run -c Release                 # build + run the tray app
dotnet publish -c Release             # single self-contained .exe -> bin\Release\net10.0-windows\win-x64\publish\

dotnet run -- --settings              # open just the Settings window (preview)
dotnet run -- --render <dir>          # dump tray-icon PNGs at 16/20/32 px
dotnet run -- --insights              # print the 24h usage breakdown to the console
dotnet run -- --makeicon ClaudeTray.ico   # regenerate the multi-resolution app icon
dotnet run -- --social docs\social-preview.png  # regenerate the social card
```

## Release process

Version lives in **one place**: `<Version>` in `ClaudeTray.csproj`. Everything derives from it.

```
# bump <Version>, then:
build-installer.cmd                   # publish + build dist\ClaudeTray-Setup.exe
```

Then create a GitHub release tagged `vX.Y.Z` and attach `ClaudeTray-Setup.exe`. Installed copies
self-update from it.

## Conventions

- **Commits**: use `run-commit.cmd -m "<conventional-commits title>"` (stages all, AI writes body).
  One commit per finished, validated task.
- **Privacy**: only token counts, model ids, and flags are ever read from transcripts — never
  message content. Keep it that way.
- **Single instance** is enforced by a named mutex; a second launch exits silently.
- The marketing page is `docs/index.html` (GitHub Pages, served from `/docs`).
